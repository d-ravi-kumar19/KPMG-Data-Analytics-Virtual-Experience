## 2. Data Insights Task 2: 
This task revolved around recommending potential high-value customers for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. By understanding customer trends and behavior, I created a comprehensive analysis and strategy for the organization. I utilized Python for analysis and created a compelling presentation.

## 3. Data Insights and Presentation Task 3: 
In this task, I'm developing an interactive dashboard to present analysis results. Visualizations are key to conveying findings effectively, and I'm utilizing creative layouts and tools in Power BI and Tableau to make the dashboard impactful.
